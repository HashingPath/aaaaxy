Sections to do:

- Grab & Push
  - BRLOGENSHFEGLE
    - Need to transport platform while NOT transforming the floor into shiny yet deadly coins.
    - I.e. time to hold button is limited.

- Grab & Stand
  - The Butterfly Effect (from Antichamber)
    - Lots of doors that are LogicalOr of three inputs (LeftSw, DoorBlocker, RightSw)
    - At the end you get stuck UNLESS you have a platforms left
    - Solution is to go to end, get the one platform that is there, walk back, block doors and collect all platforms you can find.

- Push & Stand
  - A platform race! Steer left/right, overtake other "drivers"...
