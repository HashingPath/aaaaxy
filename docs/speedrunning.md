## Speedrunning

AAAAXY has integrated speedrun timing support. Your time and run
category will be shown in the end credits.

The following run categories exist:

  - Any%: every run is Any% (but Any% is not shown if 100% is met too).
  - 100%: all regular checkpoints have been hit.
  - All Notes: all notes have been read.
  - All Paths: all connections between regular checkpoints have been
    used by the player during the run in one or the other direction.
  - All Secrets: all notes in secret rooms have been read.
  - All Flipped; all checkpoints that were seen were last seen in
    flipped/mirrored state.
  - No Escape: the game menu was never used during the run.
