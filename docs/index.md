AAAAXY is a nonlinear puzzle platformer taking place in non-Euclidean
geometry.

Although your general goal is reaching the surprising end of the game,
you are encouraged to set your own goals while playing. Exploration will
be rewarded, and secrets await you\!

So jump and run around, and enjoy losing your sense of orientation in
this World of Wicked Weirdness. Find out what Van Vlijmen will make you
do. Pick a path, get inside a Klein Bottle, recognize some memes, and by
all means: don't look up.
