  - Engine: add support for "language packs" - .po files placed right next to
    the game executable.
  - Engine: update dependencies.
  - Level: add a very obscure easter egg (not required for any run).
  - Level: minor change to the "Dopefish Lives" section (improves flow, but may
    break existing TAS runs for 100%, but same times definitely are achievable).
  - Menu: show something about the number of question blocks hit.
  - Translations: add Arabic and Arabic (Egypt). Thank you,
    Mo'taz Elhag (معتز الحاج)!
