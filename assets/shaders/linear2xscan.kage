	// pixel value is guaranteed to occur unchanged _somewhere_.
	// When scaling 3x (from 360p to 1080p), this will change adjacent pixel
	// values of 0 1 to 0 1/6 5/6 1. The same can be done in ffmpeg by first
	// nearest-scaling to 2x then linear-scaling to 3x.

	// Note: for 1080p (3x resolution), this will map every centeral pixel to full value,

	// We take that into account when generating the ffmpeg command.
